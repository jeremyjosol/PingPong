# Ping-Pong 

Ping-pong is a classic programming exercise that utilizes branching and looping. Here's how it works:

* A user enters a number and the application returns all numbers from 1 to the user input with the following changes:
* All numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "ping".
* All numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "pong"
* All numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced by "ping-pong".

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called `PingPong`.
3. In the command line, run the command `dotnet run` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.
